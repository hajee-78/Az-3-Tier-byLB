# Azure-3-Tier-Stack
This repository helps to build a 3-tier architecture in Azure using HCL Terraform.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Web Tier, Application Tier, and Data Tier are the three logical layers into which the modern application deployment divides the application using a technique known as 3-tier architecture. The web tier responds to user requests, the application tier manages and processes the data, and the data tier stores the data.
